From the [wsclean](https://wsclean.readthedocs.io/) docs:

> WSClean does not output these images in a normal “imaging cube” like CASA
> does, i.e., a single fits file with several images in it. For now I’ve decided
> not to implement this (one of the reasons for this is that information about
> the synthesized beam is not properly stored in a multi-frequency fits file).
> One has of course the option to combine the output manually, e.g. with a
> simple Python script.

This is a simple Python script to combine (single-frequency or single-Stokes)
FITS images manually.

Current assumptions:

- All files have the same WCS
- All files have the same shape / pixel grid
- Frequency is either a WCS axis or in the REFFREQ header keyword
- All the relevant information is in the first header of the first image

## Installation

Install from PyPI (stable):

```
pip install fitscube
```

Or, onstall from this git repo (latest):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/AlecThomson/fitscube.git
```

## Usage

Command line:

```bash
❯ fitscube -h
usage: fitscube [-h] [-o] [--create-blanks] [--freq-file FREQ_FILE | --freqs FREQS [FREQS ...] | --ignore-freq] [-v] [--max-workers MAX_WORKERS] file_list [file_list ...] out_cube

Fitscube: Combine single-frequency FITS files into a cube. Assumes: - All files have the same WCS - All files have the same shape / pixel grid - Frequency is either a WCS axis or in the REFFREQ header keyword -
All the relevant information is in the first header of the first image

positional arguments:
  file_list             List of FITS files to combine (in frequency order)
  out_cube              Output FITS file

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o, --overwrite       Overwrite output file if it exists
  --create-blanks       Try to create a blank cube with evenly spaced frequencies
  --freq-file FREQ_FILE
                        File containing frequencies in Hz
  --freqs FREQS [FREQS ...]
                        List of frequencies in Hz
  --ignore-freq         Ignore frequency information and just stack (probably not what you want)
  -v, --verbosity       Increase output verbosity
  --max-workers MAX_WORKERS
                        Maximum number of workers to use for concurrent processing
```

Python:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from fitscube import combine_fits

file_list = list(Path().glob("*.fits"))

frequencies = combine_fits(
    file_list
)
```
